## Files Included

1. **index_secured.html** - Updated website with video background and SEO optimizations
2. **sitemap.xml** - Sitemap for search engines

Place these files in the root of your GitHub Pages repository:

- `sitemap.xml`
- `robots.txt`
- Your video at `Videos/CoreMotion.mp4`

### 2. Submit to Google Search Console (CRITICAL)

This is the most important step for getting indexed:

1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/)
2. Add your property: `https://pkudzia.github.io/trackmycore.github.io/`
3. Verify ownership (GitHub Pages can use the HTML tag method)
4. Submit your sitemap:
   - Go to "Sitemaps" in the left menu
   - Enter: `sitemap.xml`
   - Click "Submit"
5. Request indexing:
   - Go to "URL Inspection"
   - Enter your homepage URL
   - Click "Request Indexing"

### 3. Submit to Bing Webmaster Tools (Optional but Recommended)

1. Go to [Bing Webmaster Tools](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/)
2. Import from Google Search Console (easiest method)
3. Submit your sitemap

### 4. Create Google Business Profile (If Applicable)

If CoreMotion has a physical location:
1. Go to [Google Business Profile](https://business.google.com/)
2. Create a profile for CoreMotion Technologies Inc.
3. Link to your website

## SEO Keywords Targeted

The website is now optimized for these search terms:
- ACL wearable
- ACL biomechanics
- ACL rehabilitation device
- Wearable biofeedback
- ACL return to sport
- Knee rehabilitation technology
- Movement analysis wearable
- Physiotherapy technology
- Sports medicine wearable
- ACL injury prevention

## Additional SEO Recommendations

### Content Strategy
1. **Start a blog** - Write articles about ACL rehabilitation, biomechanics, and return-to-sport protocols
2. **Create case studies** - Document successful pilot results
3. **Publish research** - Link to any papers or presentations

### Link Building
1. Get listed on physiotherapy directories
2. Partner with sports medicine blogs for guest posts
3. Connect with university research programs
4. Get mentioned in industry publications

### Technical SEO
1. Ensure page loads under 3 seconds
2. Compress the video file (aim for under 10MB if possible)
3. Use WebP format for images when possible
4. Enable GZIP compression (GitHub Pages does this automatically)

### Monitor Performance
1. Check Google Search Console weekly for:
   - Index coverage issues
   - Search performance data
   - Core Web Vitals scores
2. Track rankings for target keywords using tools like:
   - Google Search Console (free)
   - Ahrefs (paid)
   - SEMrush (paid)

## Video Background Notes

The video will:
- Autoplay on page load (muted, as required by browsers)
- Loop continuously
- Fall back to Banner.png if video fails to load
- Respect "prefers-reduced-motion" accessibility setting

## Timeline Expectations

- **Initial indexing**: 1-4 weeks after submitting to Google Search Console
- **Ranking improvements**: 2-6 months of consistent SEO work
- **Top rankings**: Requires ongoing content creation and link building

For competitive keywords like "ACL wearable", reaching the first page typically takes 6-12 months of dedicated SEO effort.
